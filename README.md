🥔 Potato Disease Detection API
A simple FastAPI endpoint for detecting potato leaf diseases using a TensorFlow transfer learning model.

🚩 Features
✅ Detects potato leaf diseases from images.
✅ Returns predicted disease class and confidence score.
✅ Built for hackathon 2025 crop disease detection workflow.

🚀 Usage
1️⃣ Start the server:
uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload

2️⃣ Test the API:

GET / → Health check.

POST /predict → Upload a leaf image (file field) to get prediction.
